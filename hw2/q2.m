%% Scenario 2
% Scenario 2: Implement the linear estimator for multiple noisy 
% observations, similar to example 8.8 from the notes. Extend this example 
% so that it works for an arbitrary number of observations. Use Gaussian 
% random variables for Y and R. Set Î¼y = 1. Experiment with a few different
% variances for both Y and R. On one plot, show the mean squared error of 
% your simulation compared to the theoretical values for at least 2 
% different pairs of variances.
